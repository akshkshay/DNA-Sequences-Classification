# DNA-Sequences-Classification
## Classifying DNA Sequences
 Objective behind this project is that, I am trying to explore the world of bioinformatics by using Markov models, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms, support vector machines, and other common classifiers to classify short E. Coli DNA sequences. This project will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each.

***With this project, I am trying to learn how to:***

* Import data from the UCI repository.
* Convert text inputs to numerical data.
* Build and train classification algorithms.
* Compare and contrast classification algorithms.
